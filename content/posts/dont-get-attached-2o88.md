One of the situations you will encounter in the professional world of web development is that things won't always go your way. There will be times when you gave it your all and maybe 110% with element of rush because of a tight deadline to finish a task, and then you hear your project manager saying, we're descoping the project and focus on another one. 

Your heart sinks. 

But as someone who has been doing this for more than 8 years, I have developed an attitude towards code that this may not be used. Your code which you have worked on can be deprioritized, postponed or worse, may never be used.

So useful tip, don't get attached. Just think of the learnings you have gained through it, document it as much as possible, and try to move on. 

Your code unpublished doesn't mean you're not a good developer. The experience you get from it matters the most.
